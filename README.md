# ALX School - 0x00-hello_world

This repository is dedicated to the 0x00-hello_world project at ALX School. The project focuses on compiling very simple programs using the gcc compiler and learning the essential steps of compilation.

## New commands / functions used:

During this project, you will become familiar with the following commands and functions:

- **gcc**: `gcc` is a popular compiler used for compiling C programs. It translates the source code written in C into machine-readable instructions.

- **printf**: `printf` is a function in the C programming language used for printing formatted output on the console. It allows you to display information, such as strings and variables, in a specific format.

- **puts**: `puts` is a function in C used to write a string to the console. It automatically appends a newline character after the string.

- **putchar**: `putchar` is a function in C used to write a single character to the console. It is often used to display individual characters or create simple text-based interfaces.

By using these commands and functions, you will gain a better understanding of how to write and compile simple C programs. The project will help you grasp the fundamental concepts of compilation and build a solid foundation for future programming tasks.

Feel free to explore the repository and learn from the code examples provided. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding!
